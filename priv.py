# RISC-V has four privilege levels, one of them is reserved
# as we are writing an operating system running at supervisor level
# we can pay less attention to machine level, as the interaction between
# supervisor and user, is mostly identical to the one between machine and supervisor
# while it may be hard for newcomers to grasp an idea of the role of each level
# knowing that every subsequent level is more privileged than the previous one is enough now
class PrivilegeLevel(Enum):
    User = 0
    Supervisor = 1
    Reserved = 2
    Machine = 3

# when a RISC-V machine boots, it starts in machine level
# and runs a special piece of software called Supervisor Binary Interface, SBI for short
# we normally call that "firmware" or something
# it then *switches privilege level* and handles control
# to our operating system running in supervisor level
# whose job is to *switch privilege level* again and handle control 
# to the userland programs

# but why should privilege levels exist in the first place
# if their only purpose is to pass the control to lower levels
# the answer is obvious, imagine a machine with two users
# one of them is badly behaved, he not only wants to steal
# the other one's secrets, but also run a deadloop forever
# so that nobody can use the machine other than him
# this is exactly when we need a supervisor
# who regulate the behavior of lower levels

# specifically, we need a mechanism to transfer control
# back to higher privilege levels, when an *exception* or an *interrupt* fires
# speaking of exceptions, a prominent example is illegal instruction
# programs running in low privilege levels may try to run privileged instructions
# which is certainly something the supervisor should be notified of
# for interrupts, timer interrupt is the most common one
# so that the supervisor can check from time to time
# whether someone is taking the machine for too long
# the mechanism in question, is called trap

# for controlling the interaction between privilege levels
# such as what to do when a trap occurs
# RISC-V has special registers called: Control and Status Register, CSR for short
# there are hundreds of CSRs in the current RISC-V specification
# thus we would only focus on a few interesting ones

# stvec: supervisor trap vector base address register
# controls where should the machine jump to on traps
class STVec():
    class Mode(Enum):
        Direct = 0 # just set pc to BASE
        Vectored = 1 # set pc to BASE+4Ã—cause
    base = 0 # a valid memory address
    mode = Mode.Direct # how to calculate the target address relative to BASE

# scause: supervisor cause register
# tells the supervisor cause of the trap
class SCause():
    interrupt = False # whether the trap is cause by an interrupt or an exception
    code = 0 # type of the interrupt or exception, for example exception number 2 is illegal instruction

# sepc: supervisor exception program counter
class SEPC():
    # address of the instruction that was interrupted or caused the exception
    # also the address to return to after we handled the trap
    sepc = 0 

# sstatus: supervisor status register
# this is a particularly heavy duty CSR packed with many fields
# and we intentionally omit most of them for easier understanding
class SStatus():
    # the privilege level the machine was at before the trap
    # also the privilege level to enter after we return from the trap
